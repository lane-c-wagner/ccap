# CAMP - Crypto Alias Management Protocol

CAMP is a sub-protocol of OpenCap. CAMP is an optional protocol that allows a server to facilitate the creation, updating, and deletion of a user's alias resources. For a server to be CAMP compliant it must also be CAP compliant by serving aliases, CAMP is essentially a "tier 2" protocol built on top of CAP to add some more features.

The following endpoints are required:

## POST /v1/users

This endpoint is intended to create new users on the server. The payload struture is NOT specified by the CAMP protocol becasuse each server may have different user data requirements for signing up. The minimum is that each user be given a username and password. The username defines the first part of the alias, for example:

username$domain.tld

Here is what an example payload could look like, but typically this endpoint should be accessed via a client supplied by the CAMP server so there is no confusion.

```javascript

    "username": "alice",
    "password": "mysecretpassword"
